# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game built in Python. Players can choose from three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, or Hard. Based on the chosen level, the number of attempts will vary, and the goal is to guess a randomly generated number between 0 and 100 within the given attempts.

## Features
- Three difficulty levels: Easy (8 attempts), Medium (6 attempts), and Hard (4 attempts).
- The user can quit the game anytime by pressing 'Q'.
- After each guess, the game provides feedback if the guess is too low, too high, or correct.
- The game ends when the user guesses the number correctly or runs out of attempts.

## How to Play
1. Choose your difficulty level: Easy, Medium, or Hard.
2. Try to guess the number between 0 and 100 within your allowed attempts.
3. If you want to quit, simply type 'Q'.
4. If you guess the number correctly, you win!
5. The game will end if you run out of attempts or guess the number correctly.
