# GUESSNUM-GAME
This is a number-guessing game where users can choose from three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, or Hard. Depending on the level, players are given a limited number of attempts to guess a randomly generated number between 0 and 100. Players can quit anytime by pressing 'Q'. The game gives feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
